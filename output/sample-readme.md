# Readme generator
  ## Description
This app is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input. When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. The README should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions.
